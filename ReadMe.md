# Guiding Principles

> Software's Quality can be measured by how easily it can be changed.

## Aligned to Agile and DevOps Methodologies

- Every stage on Software Development LifeCycle (SDLC) is an opportunity for Testing.
  - Design
  - Scoping
  - Implementation
  - Review
  
- Work in small batches.

- Main branch *always releasable*.

- Use Test-Driven development to write tests as you develop.

- Remove the "Ready for Test, Test, In Test" columns or statuses in your work management.  *Review* is much sufficient.

## Create a shared understanding based around Actors and roles

- Testable, unambiguous acceptance criteria.

## Automate the important and repetitive tests
  
- *Shift Left* majority of functional testing onto Pull Requests.
- Create frameworks, documentation, Proof of Concepts which allows the wider team to undertake testing activities.
